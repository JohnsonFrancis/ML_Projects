Actually, its almost impossible to make a series perfectly stationary, but we try to take it as close as possible.\n",

    "There are 2 major reasons behind non-stationaruty of a TS:<br>\n",
    "1. Trend – varying mean over time. For eg, in this case we saw that on average, the number of passengers was growing over time.<br>\n",
    "2. Seasonality – variations at specific time-frames. eg people might have a tendency to buy cars in a particular month because of pay increment or festivals.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying principle is to model or estimate the trend and seasonality in the series and remove those from the series to get a stationary series. Then statistical forecasting techniques can be implemented on this series. The final step would be to convert the forecasted values into the original scale by applying trend and seasonality constraints back."

    "Decomposition is primarily used for time series analysis, and as an analysis tool it can be used to inform forecasting models on your problem.It disaggregate a time series into three components -- trend, seasonal and residual.\n",
    "The trend component is supposed to capture the slowly-moving overall level of the series.\n",
    "The seasonal component captures patterns that repeat every season.\n",
    "The residual is what is left. It may or may not be autocorrelated. For example, there can be some autocorrelated pattern evolving quickly around the slowly moving trend plus the seasonal fluctuations. This kind of pattern cannot be ascribed to the trend component (the former moves too fast) or the seasonal component (the former does not obey seasonal timing). So it is left in the remainder.\n",
    "\n",

    "Each of these components are something you may need to think about and address during data preparation, model selection, and model tuning. You may address it explicitly in terms of modeling the trend and subtracting it from your data, or implicitly by providing enough history for an algorithm to model a trend if it may exist.\n",

    "A linear seasonality has the same frequency (width of cycles) and amplitude (height of cycles).<br>\n",

    "2) Multiplicative Model:<br>\n",
    "A multiplicative model suggests that the components are multiplied together as y(t) = Level * Trend * Seasonality * Noise. <br>\n",
    "It is nonlinear, such as quadratic or exponential. Changes increase or decrease over time.\n",

    "In time series modelling, the predictions over time become less and less accurate and hence it is a more realistic approach to re-train the model with actual data as it gets available for further predictions. Since training of statistical models are not time consuming, walk-forward validation is the most preferred solution to get most accurate results.\n",

    "In walk-forward, the datasets is divided into parts, i.e. the smallest unit that can be ordered. Then parts are chronologically ordered, and I each run, all the data available before the part to predict is used as the training set, and the part to predict is used as test-set. Afterward, the model accuracy is computed as the average among runs. Walk-forward technique is basically used to re-train the model each time as the new data is available.Time series validation techniques have both advantage and disadvantage. One of the main advantage is they replicate a realistic usage scenario. Another advantage is they are fast and inexpensive as number of runs is equal to number of parts. Another main advantage is that they are not affected by any bias related to the randomness with which the training and test sets are generated.\n",
